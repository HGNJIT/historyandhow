                        Domain names and ICANN:
                    </h1>
                    <p>
                        ICANN or the Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers, is an organization which is
                        responsible for maintaining some of the internets most important operations. ICANN develops policies
                        regarding the internet’s unique identifiers. Its responsibilities include, but are not limited to; the
                        maintenance of IP, management of DNS, TLD, the IANA, and the NTIA. As Vent Cerf said “The Internet is a
                        design philosophy and architecture, expressed in a set of protocols”. In order for the internet to
                        function as a standard global entity, these protocols must be established and maintained by one central,
                        independent agency. That’s where ICANN comes in. ICANN coordinates the naming standards which allow for
                        international standardization of naming practices.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        It’s important that ICANN always remain independent as it prevents any one entity from having control
                        over the internet and its standards. If not kept independent, a single Country or Region can decide to
                        make a change to their standards which will effectively make it impossible for them to communicate with
                        the wider internet. ICANN decides on the changes that are needed and then distributes these changes to
                        the whole world. Thereby maintaining standardized protocols.
                        ICANN is not responsible for any actual content. Instead think of it as a group that sets the rules for
                        how networks can interact with each other, in order to achieve full cooperation between all networks on
                        the internet.

                        A Domain Name uses words and characters to represent a unique IP Address. Domain Names make it easy for
                        users to navigate the internet without having to memorize all the unique IP Addresses on the internet.
                        Domain Names are made up of different parts, or labels, which help to identify which specific IP Address
                        you are trying to reach. Starting from the left most side of a URL, Protocol tells the browser what type
                        of connection to establish, these can be used for basic hypertext, secure hypertext, or file transfers.
                        Next in line is the Domain Name, which is the unique identifier designating what IP Address you want to
                        connect with. Next is the Domain Extension, which states the type of website you are connecting to.
