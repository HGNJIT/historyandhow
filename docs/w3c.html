                        W3C or the World Wide Web Consortium, like ICANN is an organization that is responsible for creating
                        standards and protocols for the usage of the Web. W3C created the standards for what websites should
                        look like. This created a sense of standardization across the web which makes it more welcoming to users
                        and creators alike. W3C coordinates with other agencies such as ICANN, Unicode Consortium, and Wireless
                        Application Protocols, to create consensus across all platforms and protocols. W3C focuses on developing
                        rules and protocols for web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and XLM. This helps to keep advancing the
                        standards for web browsing while maintaining uniformity across all web browsers.

                        HTML or Hyper Text Markup Language, is the building block for all web pages. Like its name suggests,
                        HTML is a standardized language which is used to create web pages. Hypertext means that webpages can
                        have hyperlinks that redirect users to other pages just the click of a button. One of the most important
                        parts of HTML are Elements. Elements are components that allow for the customization of web pages. In
                        its basic form, HTML is displayed as plain text on a page. The HTML Elements allows web developers to
                        take the plain text, structure and format it to produce more presentable results. Knowing the proper
                        Elements and how to effectively use them is the key to a good web developersâ€™ success. Propper usage can
                        turn a mundane webpage into an attractive inviting page that will lead to more usage from users.

                        Alongside HTML, CSS, or Cascading Style Sheets is a tool which if properly used, can change the appeal
                        of any web page. CSS allows for deep customization through a website from one central file. This has
                        many benefits when a website has many sub pages that need to be kept uniform. Instead of having to
                        detail the styling needs of a page in each individual HTML file, web developers can make changes in the
                        central CSS file and the changes will automatically be applied throughout the site. CSS also helps to
                        keep the HTML code simpler which has the added benefit of using less bandwidth. Search engine
                        optimization is also improved because the search engine crawl can scan the contents of the page faster
                        which leads to be better SEO. Combined together, W3C standards help HTML and CSS provide a better online
                        experience for all web users.
